# Bruno Alves – Technical Case Studies

This repository presents a selection of technical case studies from systems I have architected and delivered in production. Each case focuses on engineering decisions, architectural reasoning, and the implementation approaches used to solve real operational problems.

These cases do not represent all projects I have worked on, but highlight key systems that illustrate my work across fullstack engineering, backend architecture, integrations, data workflows, and AI-driven automations.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document how specific systems were designed, why certain architectural choices were made, and how the solutions were implemented in practice. The emphasis is on clarity, trade-offs, and real-world constraints rather than theoretical patterns.

## Structure

Each case is isolated in its own directory and contains:

- overview.md  
  High-level summary of the system and the business problem.

- architecture.md  
  Architectural structure, components, boundaries, and design rationale.

- flows.md  
  Key operational or technical flows that define the system behavior.

- tech-decisions.md  
  Reasoning behind major technical choices and alternatives considered.

- challenges.md  
  Issues encountered and the engineering approaches used to resolve them.

- patterns.md  
  Core patterns, abstractions, and engineering practices applied.

- results.md  
  Impact delivered and outcomes achieved.

## Cases Included

The cases documented in this repository cover systems in the areas of:

- enrollment and academic process automation  
- conversational automation and LLM-driven orchestration  
- CRM platforms with real-time event processing  
- e-commerce platforms with custom backend APIs  
- financial SaaS with multi-tenant architecture  
- analytics platforms and data pipelines  
- webhook delivery and observability systems

Each case includes details relevant to architecture, implementation, and operational design.

## Notes

All client-specific data, source code, and proprietary information are omitted. Only architectural reasoning, patterns, and high-level design details are included.
